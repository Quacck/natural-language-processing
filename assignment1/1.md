Overall, this dataset contains recipes in the form of 

    title: string
    ingredients: string[],
    picture_link?: some_url,
    instructions: string

All of these are in english language, using imperial metrics. The Ingredients are in natural language, sometimes they even give suggestions where to buy certain foods from or advertise special equipdment.

The author of that dataset scraped 3 different websites: https://github.com/rtlee9/recipe-box, so theres also some variance between those sets.
